// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the goal is to make sure every requirement will be met."
const design = "This is the third step, this step is where the software is visually planned out so every programmercan follow the design the step plans."
const implementation = "This is the forth step, this is when the software starts getting developed. All components of the software are impletmented in this step."
const testingandintegration = "This is the fifth step, the software is being tested to assure it was done correctly. This is the step they identify problems or bugs."
const maintain = "This the las step, this final step is to ensure that the software continues to run smoothly as well as fix any issues with the program that comes up."
